- **Project summary:**
  - Welcome! This is the repository for my LING2340 (Data Science for Linguists) term project. The purpose of this project is to do a cross-dialectal analysis of two competing Spanish diminutive suffixes (*-ito*, *-illo*) in terms of productivity. In order to quantify productivity, I use statistical measures (e.g., Baayen's *P*), which can be used to provide empirical grounding for descriptive claims made in the literature about the prevalence of each suffix. Lastly, this analysis also considers dialectal variation, given that varieties of Spanish might not necessarily display the same trends.
