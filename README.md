# Diminutive-Suffix-Productivity

- **An overview:**:
  - Welcome! This is the repository for my LING2340 (Data Science for Linguists) term project. The purpose of this project is to do a cross- dialectal analysis of two competing Spanish diminutive suffixes (*-ito*, *-illo*) in terms of productivity. In order to quantify productivity, I use statistical measures of productivity (e.g., Baayen's *P*), which will confirm previous descriptive claims made in the literature. Lastly, this analysis also considers dialectal variation, given that varieties of Spanish might not necessarily display the same trends.
