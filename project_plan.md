#Diminutive suffix productivity in Spanish

#Summary

This is a continuation of a project that originated in a morphology class. There are competing, functionally equivalent suffixes that can be used in Spanish, but they vary a great deal in productivity because of word-formation restrictions and dialectal variation. The idea is to do a cross-dialectal analysis using tokens drawn from a large-scale corpus and incorporate statistical measures of productivity (e.g., Baayen's P) to back up previous descriptive claims made about how common the suffixes are.
